# Convert CEM Rims To SPK
Easy convert old LFS CEM Rims to new LFS Editor SPK ones. One by one or all at once :) (Extract to Folder with CEM files)

Alternative instruction: [**_LFS EDITOR - Load rims from .cem files (QUICKER WAY)_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV2zJepck8Q)

Also for most rims you need this CheatEngine table: [**_OBJ/SRE Restriction Bypass for LFS EDITOR 0.7B5_**](https://gist.github.com/PodFolio/8391de905d34c242f9f4afde4bed3885?utm_source=github)
